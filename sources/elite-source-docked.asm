\
\ The adjective for the current system is generated by taking the system name,

\
\   * Lave gives Lavian (as in "Lavian tree grub")

\ This routine is called by jump token 17, {system name adjective}, and it can

\ 14, {justify} - because the routine needs to use the line buffer to work.

\             Pitching and rolling
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Apply pitch and roll angles alpha and beta to the orientation vector in Y.
\
\ Specifically, this routine rotates a point (x, y, z) around the origin by
\ pitch alpha and roll beta, using the small angle approximation to make the
\ maths easier, and incorporating the Minsky circle algorithm to make the
\ rotation more stable (though more elliptic).
\
\ If that paragraph makes sense to you, then you should probably be writing
\ this commentary! For the rest of us, there's a detailed explanation of all
\ this in the deep dive on "Pitching and rolling".
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       transform:

\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The first vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   RAT2                The direction of the pitch or roll to perform, positive
\                       or negative (i.e. the sign of the roll or pitch counter
\                       in bit 7)

\       Name: TENS
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Text
\    Summary: A constant used when printing large numbers in BPRNT
\  Deep dive: Printing decimal numbers
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Contains the four low bytes of the value 100,000,000,000 (100 billion).
\
\ The maximum number of digits that we can print with the BPRNT routine is 11,
\ so the biggest number we can print is 99,999,999,999. This maximum number
\ plus 1 is 100,000,000,000, which in hexadecimal is:
\
\   & 17 48 76 E8 00
\
\ The TENS variable contains the lowest four bytes in this number, with the
\ most significant byte first, i.e. 48 76 E8 00. This value is used in the
\ BPRNT routine when working out which decimal digits to print when printing a
\ number.

\
\ This variable is used to change characters to lower case as part of applying
\ Sentence Case to extended text tokens. It has two values:
\
\   * %00100000 = apply lower case to the second letter of a word onwards
\
\   * %00000000 = do not change case to lower case
\
\ The default value is %00100000 (apply lower case).
\
\ The flag is set to %00100000 (apply lower case) by jump token 2, {sentence

\
\ The flag is set to %00000000 (do not change case to lower case) by jump token
\ 1, {all caps}, which calls routine MT1 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The letter to print is OR'd with DTW1 in DETOK2, which lower-cases the letter
\ by setting bit 5 (if DTW1 is %00100000). However, this OR is only done if bit
\ 7 of DTW2 is clear, i.e. we are printing a word, so this doesn't affect the
\ first letter of the word, which remains capitalised.

\   * %11011111 = capitalise the next letter
\

\ The default value is %11111111 (do not change case).

\    Summary: Fetch the current dashboard colours, to support flashing
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set A and X to the colours we should use for indicators showing dangerous and
\ safe values respectively. This enables us to implement flashing indicators,
\ which is one of the game's configurable options.
\
\ If flashing is enabled, the colour returned in A (dangerous values) will be
\ red for 8 iterations of the main loop, and yellow/white for the next 8, before
\ going back to red. If we always use PZW to decide which colours we should use
\ when updating indicators, flashing colours will be automatically taken care of
\ for us.
\
\ The values returned are &F0 for yellow/white and &0F for red. These are mode 5
\ bytes that contain 4 pixels, with the colour of each pixel given in two bits,
\ the high bit from the first nibble (bits 4-7) and the low bit from the second
\ nibble (bits 0-3). So in &F0 each pixel is %10, or colour 2 (yellow or white,
\ depending on the dashboard palette), while in &0F each pixel is %01, or colour
\ 1 (red).
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The colour to use for indicators with dangerous values
\
\   X                   The colour to use for indicators with safe values

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table contains groups of ships to show in the ship hanger. A group of
\ ships is shown half the time (the other half shows a solo ship), and each of
\ the four groups is equally likely.
\
\ The bytes for each ship in the group contain the following information:
\
\   Byte #0             Non-zero = Ship type to draw
\                       0        = don't draw anything
\
\   Byte #1             Bits 0-7 = Ship's x_hi
\                       Bit 0    = Ship's z_hi (1 if clear, or 2 if set)
\
\   Byte #2             Bits 0-7 = Ship's z_lo
\                       Bit 0    = Ship's x_sign
\
\ Ths ship's y-coordinate is calculated in the has1 routine from the size of
\ its targetable area. Ships of type 0 are not shown.
\
\ Note that ship numbers are for the ship hanger blueprints at XX21 in the
\ docked code, rather than the full set of ships in the flight code. They are:
\

\
\       Name: HANGER
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Ship hanger
\    Summary: Display the ship hanger
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called after the ships in the hanger have been drawn, so all
\ it has to do is draw the hanger's background.
\
\ The hanger background is made up of two parts:
\
\   * The hanger floor consists of 11 screen-wide horizontal lines, which start
\     out quite spaced out near the bottom of the screen, and bunch ever closer
\     together as the eye moves up towards the horizon, where they merge to give
\     a sense of perspective
\
\   * The back wall of the hanger consists of 15 equally spaced vertical lines
\     that join the horizon to the top of the screen
\
\ The ships in the hangar have already been drawn by this point, so the lines
\ are drawn so they don't overlap anything that's already there, which makes
\ them look like they are behind and below the ships. This is achieved by
\ drawing the lines in from the screen edges until they bump into something
\ already on-screen. For the horizontal lines, when there are multiple ships in
\ the hanger, this also means drawing lines between the ships, as well as in
\ from each side.

\    Summary: Draw a ship in the ship hanger
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The ship's position within the hanger is determined by the arguments and the
\ size of the ship's targetable area, as follows:
\
\   * The x-coordinate is (x_sign x_hi 0) from the arguments, so the ship can be
\     left of centre or right of centre
\
\   * The y-coordinate is negative and is lower down the screen for smaller
\     ships, so smaller ships are drawn closer to the ground (because they are)
\
\   * The z-coordinate is positive, with both z_hi (which is 1 or 2) and z_lo
\     coming from the arguments
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15                Bits 0-7 = Ship's z_lo

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The animation gets drawn like this. First, we draw a circle of radius 8 at the

\ again and draw a circle, and we keep doing this until the radius is bigger
\ than 160 (which goes beyond the edge of the screen, which is 256 pixels wide,
\ equivalent to a radius of 128). We then repeat this whole process for an
\ initial circle of radius 9, then radius 10, all the way up to radius 15.
\
\ This has the effect of making the tunnel appear to be racing towards us as we
\ hurtle out into hyperspace or through the space station's docking tunnel.
\
\ The hyperspace effect is done in a full mode 5 screen, which makes the rings
\ all coloured and zig-zaggy, while the launch screen is in the normal
\ monochrome mode 4 screen.

\
\ For standard tonne canisters, the limit is given by the type of cargo hold we
\ have, with a standard cargo hold having a capacity of 20t and an extended
\ cargo bay being 35t.
\
\ For items measured in kg (gold, platinum), g (gem-stones) and alien items,

\ Calculate system data from the seeds in QQ15 and store them in the relevant

\
\ The ranges of the various values are shown in brackets. Note that the radius

\    Summary: Get a number from the keyboard
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Get a number from the keyboard, up to the maximum number in QQ25, for the
\ buying and selling of cargo and equipment.
\
\ Pressing "Y" will return the maximum number (i.e. buy/sell all items), while

\ it prints it. Tokens are null-terminated in memory and fill three pages,

\    Summary: Add a new ship to our local bubble of universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This creates a new block of ship data in the K% workspace, allocates a new
\ block in the ship line heap at WP, adds the new ship's type into the first
\ empty slot in FRIN, and adds a pointer to the ship data into UNIV. If there
\ isn't enough free memory for the new ship, it isn't added.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The type of the ship to add (see variable XX21 for a
\                       list of ship types)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the ship was successfully added, clear if it
\                       wasn't (as there wasn't enough free memory)
\
\   INF                 Points to the new ship's data block in K%

\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines

\       Name: SFX
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Sound
\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the first byte is the channel while the
\ second is the flush control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound,
\ while a flush control of 1 makes the sound instantly). When written in
\ hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush control, while the second is
\ the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1 and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.

\

\ is printer out as part of the TITLE routine.

\   Category: Utility routines
\    Summary: The standard BRKV handler for the game
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used to display error messages, before restarting the game.
\ When called, it makes a beep and prints the system error message in the block
\ pointed to by (&FD &FE), which is where the MOS will put any system errors. It
\ then waits for a key press and restarts the game.
\
\ BRKV is set to this routine in the decryption routine at DEEOR just before the
\ game is run for the first time, and at the end of the SVE routine after the
\ disc access menu has been processed. In other words, this is the standard
\ BRKV handler for the game, and it's swapped out to MRBRK for disc access
\ operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main differences between this routine and the MEBRK handler
\ that is used during disc access operations are that this routine restarts the
\ game rather than returning to the disc access menu, and this handler
\ decrements the brkd counter.

\    Summary: The BRKV handler for disc access operations
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used to display error messages from the disc filing system
\ while disc access operations are being performed. When called, it makes a beep
\ and prints the system error message in the block pointed to by (&FD &FE),
\ which is where the disc filing system will put any disc errors (such as "File
\ not found", "Disc error" and so on). It then waits for a key press and returns
\ to the disc access menu.
\
\ BRKV is set to this routine at the start of the SVE routine, just before the
\ disc access menu is shown, and it reverts to BRBR at the end of the SVE
\ routine after the disc access menu has been processed. In other words, BRBR is
\ the standard BRKV handler for the game, and it's swapped out to MRBRK for disc
\ access operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main difference between this routine and the standard BRKV
\ handler in BRBR is that this routine returns to the disc access menu rather
\ than restarting the game, and it doesn't decrement the brkd counter.

\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ We do this by dividing each of the three coordinates by the length of the
\ vector, which we can calculate using Pythagoras. Once normalised, 96 (&E0) is
\ used to represent a value of 1, and 96 with bit 7 set (&E0) is used to
\ represent -1. This enables us to represent fractional values of less than 1
\ using integers.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15                The vector to normalise, with:
\
\                         * The x-coordinate in XX15
\
\                         * The y-coordinate in XX15+1
\
\                         * The z-coordinate in XX15+2
\
\ Returns:
\

\    Summary: Toggle a configuration setting and emit a beep
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the
\ game's configuration.
\
\ Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the
\ following keys:
\
\   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (&40)
\   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (&41)
\   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (&42)
\   * F toggles flashing console bars (&43)
\   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (&44)
\   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (&45)
\   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (&46)
\
\ The numbers in brackets are the internal key numbers (see p.142 of the
\ Advanced User Guide for a list of internal key numbers). We pass the key that
\ has been pressed in X, and the configuration option to check it against in Y,
\ so this routine is typically called in a loop that loops through the various
\ configuration options.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The internal number of the key that's been pressed
\
\   Y                   The internal number of the configuration key to check
\                       against, from the list above (i.e. Y must be from &40 to
\                       &46)

                        \ at location DJD, which is DAMP+1, and so on. So we
                        \ can toggle the configuration byte by changing the
                        \ byte at DAMP + (X - &40), or to put it in indexing
                        \ terms, DAMP-&40,X. It's no coincidence that the
