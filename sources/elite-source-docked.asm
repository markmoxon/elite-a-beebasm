\
\ The adjective for the current system is generated by taking the system name,

\
\   * Lave gives Lavian (as in "Lavian tree grub")

\ This routine is called by jump token 17, {system name adjective}, and it can

\ 14, {justify} - because the routine needs to use the line buffer to work.

\             Pitching and rolling
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Apply pitch and roll angles alpha and beta to the orientation vector in Y.
\
\ Specifically, this routine rotates a point (x, y, z) around the origin by
\ pitch alpha and roll beta, using the small angle approximation to make the
\ maths easier, and incorporating the Minsky circle algorithm to make the
\ rotation more stable (though more elliptic).
\
\ If that paragraph makes sense to you, then you should probably be writing
\ this commentary! For the rest of us, there's a detailed explanation of all
\ this in the deep dive on "Pitching and rolling".
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       transform:

\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The first vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   RAT2                The direction of the pitch or roll to perform, positive
\                       or negative (i.e. the sign of the roll or pitch counter
\                       in bit 7)

\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:

\   * |delta_y| >= |delta_x|
\
\   * The line is closer to being vertical than horizontal
\

\       Name: TENS
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Text
\    Summary: A constant used when printing large numbers in BPRNT
\  Deep dive: Printing decimal numbers
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Contains the four low bytes of the value 100,000,000,000 (100 billion).
\
\ The maximum number of digits that we can print with the BPRNT routine is 11,
\ so the biggest number we can print is 99,999,999,999. This maximum number
\ plus 1 is 100,000,000,000, which in hexadecimal is:
\
\   & 17 48 76 E8 00
\
\ The TENS variable contains the lowest four bytes in this number, with the
\ most significant byte first, i.e. 48 76 E8 00. This value is used in the
\ BPRNT routine when working out which decimal digits to print when printing a
\ number.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This variable is used to change characters to lower case as part of applying
\ Sentence Case to extended text tokens. It has two values:
\
\   * %00100000 = apply lower case to the second letter of a word onwards
\
\   * %00000000 = do not change case to lower case
\
\ The default value is %00100000 (apply lower case).
\
\ The flag is set to %00100000 (apply lower case) by jump token 2, {sentence

\
\ The flag is set to %00000000 (do not change case to lower case) by jump token
\ 1, {all caps}, which calls routine MT1 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The letter to print is OR'd with DTW1 in DETOK2, which lower-cases the letter
\ by setting bit 5 (if DTW1 is %00100000). However, this OR is only done if bit
\ 7 of DTW2 is clear, i.e. we are printing a word, so this doesn't affect the
\ first letter of the word, which remains capitalised.

\   * %11011111 = capitalise the next letter
\

\ The default value is %11111111 (do not change case).

\
\ The letter to print is AND'd with DTW8 in DETOK2, which capitalises the letter
