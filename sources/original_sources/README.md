# Original source files for Elite-A

This folder contains the original source files for Elite-A. They were built using Angus Duggan's own handwritten assembler.

The Python script converts these sources into a format that compiles in BeebAsm. See the instructions at the start of the script for details.

Right on, Commanders!
