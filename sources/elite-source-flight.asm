\       Name: STARS6
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ See STARS1 for an explanation of the maths used in this routine. The
\ calculations are as follows:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. x = x - |x_hi| * q
\   3. y = y - |y_hi| * q
\   4. z = z + speed * 64
\
\   5. y = y - alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x + alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x - 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y + beta * 256

\
\ Add a doubled nosev vector coordinate, e.g. (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2, to
\ an INWK coordinate, e.g. (x_sign x_hi x_lo), storing the result in the INWK
\ coordinate. The axes used in each side of the addition are specified by the
\ arguments X and Y.
\
\ In the comments below, we document the routine as if we are doing the
\ following, i.e. if X = 0 and Y = 11:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2
\
\ as that way the variable names in the comments contain "x" and "y" to match
\ the registers that specify the vector axis to use.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The coordinate to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If X = 0, add (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\                         * If X = 3, add (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\                         * If X = 6, add (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\   Y                   The vector to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  add (nosev_x_hi nosev_x_lo)
\                         * If Y = 11, add (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo)

\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The first vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set A and X to the colours we should use for indicators showing dangerous and
\ safe values respectively. This enables us to implement flashing indicators,
\ which is one of the game's configurable options.
\
\ If flashing is enabled, the colour returned in A (dangerous values) will be
\ red for 8 iterations of the main loop, and yellow/white for the next 8, before
\ going back to red. If we always use PZW to decide which colours we should use
\ when updating indicators, flashing colours will be automatically taken care of
\ for us.
\
\ The values returned are &F0 for yellow/white and &0F for red. These are mode 5
\ bytes that contain 4 pixels, with the colour of each pixel given in two bits,
\ the high bit from the first nibble (bits 4-7) and the low bit from the second
\ nibble (bits 0-3). So in &F0 each pixel is %10, or colour 2 (yellow or white,
\ depending on the dashboard palette), while in &0F each pixel is %01, or colour
\ 1 (red).
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The colour to use for indicators with dangerous values
\

\    Summary: Update the roll or pitch indicator on the dashboard
\  Deep dive: The dashboard indicators
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The indicator can show a vertical bar in 16 positions, with a value of 8
\ showing the bar in the middle of the indicator.
\
\ In practice this routine is only ever called with A in the range 1 to 15, so
\ the vertical bar never appears in the leftmost position (though it does appear
\ in the rightmost).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The offset of the vertical bar to show in the indicator,
\                       from 0 at the far left, to 8 in the middle, and 15 at
\                       the far right
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              The C flag is set

                        \ along one character block at a time. Y will be used as
                        \ a pixel row counter to work our way through the
                        \ character blocks, so each time we draw a character
                        \ block, we will increment Y by 8 to move on to the next
                        \ block (as each character block contains 8 rows)

                        \ fetches a mode 5 1-pixel byte with the pixel position
                        \ at X, so the pixel is at the offset that we want for

                        \ escape pod fitted. We AND this with A so that we only

\ This routine is like a mash-up of MU11 and FMLTU. It uses part of FMLTU's
\ inverted argument trick to work out whether or not to do an addition, and like
\ MU11 it sets up a counter in X to extract bits from (P+1 P). But this time we
\ extract 16 bits from (P+1 P), so the result is a 24-bit number. The core of
\ the algorithm is still the shift-and-add approach explained in MULT1, just
\ with more bits.
\
\ Returns:
\
\   Q                   Q is preserved
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   MLTU2-2             Set Q to X, so this calculates (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * X

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following division and remainder:
\
\   P = DELTA / (the Y-th stardust particle's z_hi coordinate)
\
\   R = remainder as a fraction of A, where 1.0 = 255
\
\ Another way of saying the above is this:
\
\   (P R) = 256 * DELTA / z_hi
\
\ DELTA is a value between 1 and 40, and the minimum z_hi is 16 (dust particles
\ are removed at lower values than this), so this means P is between 0 and 2
\ (as 40 / 16 = 2.5, so the maximum result is P = 2 and R = 128.
\
\ This uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm as TIS2, but this time we
\ keep the remainder.

\ difference in the number of shifts between the top and bottom (as shifting
\ both of them once in the same direction won't change the result). It then

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Increase ("bump up") X by A, where X is either the current rate of pitch or
\ the current rate of roll.
\
\ The rate of pitch or roll ranges from 1 to 255 with 128 as the centre point.
\ This is the amount by which the pitch or roll is currently changing, so 1
\ means it is decreasing at the maximum rate, 128 means it is not changing,
\ and 255 means it is increasing at the maximum rate. These values correspond
\ to the line on the DC or RL indicators on the dashboard, with 1 meaning full
\ left, 128 meaning the middle, and 255 meaning full right.
\
\ If bumping up X would push it past 255, then X is set to 255.
\
\ If keyboard auto-recentre is configured and the result is less than 128, we
\ bump X up to the mid-point, 128. This is the equivalent of having a roll or
\ pitch in the left half of the indicator, when increasing the roll or pitch
\ should jump us straight to the mid-point.

\
\ Calculate system data from the seeds in QQ15 and store them in the relevant

\ 16-bit seeds in QQ15 (using only s0_hi, s1_hi and s1_lo):
\
\   QQ3 = economy (0-7)
\   QQ4 = government (0-7)
\   QQ5 = technology level (0-14)
\   QQ6 = population * 10 (1-71)
\   QQ7 = productivity (96-62480)
\
\ The ranges of the various values are shown in brackets. Note that the radius
\ and type of inhabitant are calculated on-the-fly in the TT25 routine when
\ the system data gets displayed, so they aren't calculated here.

\    Summary: Add a new ship to our local bubble of universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This creates a new block of ship data in the K% workspace, allocates a new
\ block in the ship line heap at WP, adds the new ship's type into the first
\ empty slot in FRIN, and adds a pointer to the ship data into UNIV. If there
\ isn't enough free memory for the new ship, it isn't added.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The type of the ship to add (see variable XX21 for a
\                       list of ship types)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the ship was successfully added, clear if it
\                       wasn't (as there wasn't enough free memory)
\
\   INF                 Points to the new ship's data block in K%

                        \ this, we need to loop through all the slots to look
                        \ for an empty one, so set a counter in X that starts

\   V                   As we draw lines for the new sun, V contains the
\                       vertical distance between the line we're drawing and the
\                       centre of the new sun. As we draw lines and move up the
\                       screen, we either decrement (bottom half) or increment
\                       (top half) this value. See the deep dive on "Drawing the
\                       sun" to see a diagram that shows V in action
\
\   V+1                 This determines which half of the new sun we are drawing
\                       as we work our way up the screen, line by line:
\
\                         * 0 means we are drawing the bottom half, so the lines
\                           get wider as we work our way up towards the centre,
\                           at which point we will move into the top half, and
\                           V+1 will switch to &FF
\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines
\                           get smaller as we work our way up, away from the
\                           centre
\
\   TGT                 The maximum y-coordinate of the new sun on-screen (i.e.
\                       the screen y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new
\                       sun)
\
\   CNT                 The fringe size of the new sun
\
\   K2(1 0)             The new sun's radius squared, i.e. K^2
\
\   Y                   The y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new sun

\
\ Set X1 and X2 to the x-coordinates of the ends of the horizontal line with

\ The resulting line gets clipped to the edges of the screen, if needed. If the
\ calculation doesn't overflow, we return with the C flag clear, otherwise the C
\ flag gets set to indicate failure and the Y-th LSO entry gets set to 0.

\
\ Scan the keyboard and joystick for cursor key or stick movement, and return
\ the result as deltas (changes) in x- and y-coordinates as follows:
\
\   * For joystick, X and Y are integers between -2 and +2 depending on how far
\     the stick has moved
\
\   * For keyboard, X and Y are integers between -1 and +1 depending on which
\     keys are pressed
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The key pressed, if the arrow keys were used
\
\   X                   Change in the x-coordinate according to the cursor keys
\                       being pressed or joystick movement, as an integer (see
\                       above)
\

\       Name: SFX
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Sound
\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the first byte is the channel while the
\ second is the flush control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound,
\ while a flush control of 1 makes the sound instantly). When written in
\ hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush control, while the second is
\ the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1 and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.

\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ We do this by dividing each of the three coordinates by the length of the
\ vector, which we can calculate using Pythagoras. Once normalised, 96 (&E0) is
\ used to represent a value of 1, and 96 with bit 7 set (&E0) is used to
\ represent -1. This enables us to represent fractional values of less than 1
\ using integers.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15                The vector to normalise, with:
\
\                         * The x-coordinate in XX15
\
\                         * The y-coordinate in XX15+1
\
\                         * The z-coordinate in XX15+2
\
\ Returns:
\
\   XX15                The normalised vector
\
\   Q                   The length of the original XX15 vector

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the
\ game's configuration.
\
\ Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the
\ following keys:
\
\   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (&40)
\   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (&41)
\   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (&42)
\   * F toggles flashing console bars (&43)
\   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (&44)
\   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (&45)
\   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (&46)
\
\ The numbers in brackets are the internal key numbers (see p.142 of the
\ Advanced User Guide for a list of internal key numbers). We pass the key that
\ has been pressed in X, and the configuration option to check it against in Y,
\ so this routine is typically called in a loop that loops through the various
\ configuration options.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The internal number of the key that's been pressed
\
\   Y                   The internal number of the configuration key to check
\                       against, from the list above (i.e. Y must be from &40 to

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
\ Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
\ by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
\ following:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
\ it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
\ routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
\ 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
\ sign of the delta.)
\
\ The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
\ is determined by the value of X.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
\
\   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:
\
\                         * X = 0 adds the delta to (x_lo, x_hi, x_sign)
\
\                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)

\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Apply pitch and roll angles alpha and beta to the orientation vector in Y.
\
\ Specifically, this routine rotates a point (x, y, z) around the origin by
\ pitch alpha and roll beta, using the small angle approximation to make the
\ maths easier, and incorporating the Minsky circle algorithm to make the
\ rotation more stable (though more elliptic).
\
\ If that paragraph makes sense to you, then you should probably be writing
\ this commentary! For the rest of us, there's a detailed explanation of all
\ this in the deep dive on "Pitching and rolling".
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       transform:

\
\                         * Y = 15 rotates roofv: (roofv_x, roofv_y, roofv_z)
